	abstract = {With a rapidly increasing fraction of electricity generation being sourced from wind, extreme wind power generation events such as prolonged periods of low (or high) generation and ramps in generation, are a growing concern for the efficient and secure operation of national power systems. As extreme events occur infrequently, long and reliable meteorological records are required to accurately estimate their characteristics. Recent publications have begun to investigate the use of global meteorological “reanalysis” data sets for power system applications, many of which focus on long-term average statistics such as monthly-mean generation. Here we demonstrate that reanalysis data can also be used to estimate the frequency of relatively short-lived extreme events (including ramping on sub-daily time scales). Verification against 328 surface observation stations across the United Kingdom suggests that near-surface wind variability over spatiotemporal scales greater than around 300 km and 6 h can be faithfully reproduced using reanalysis, with no need for costly dynamical downscaling. A case study is presented in which a state-of-the-art, 33 year reanalysis data set ({MERRA}, from {NASA}-{GMAO}), is used to construct an hourly time series of nationally-aggregated wind power generation in Great Britain ({GB}), assuming a fixed, modern distribution of wind farms. The resultant generation estimates are highly correlated with recorded data from National Grid in the recent period, both for instantaneous hourly values and for variability over time intervals greater than around 6 h. This 33 year time series is then used to quantify the frequency with which different extreme {GB}-wide wind power generation events occur, as well as their seasonal and inter-annual variability. Several novel insights into the nature of extreme wind power generation events are described, including (i) that the number of prolonged low or high generation events is well approximated by a Poission-like random process, and (ii) whilst in general there is large seasonal variability, the magnitude of the most extreme ramps is similar in both summer and winter.

	abstract = {This {PhD} explores the influence of winter weather on the British energy system. It
investigates the effect of weather variability on electricity and gas demand and on
wind power generation. Weather-driven extremes of energy demand have a significant impact on the wider energy system, and therefore their risk is quantified and
the driving circulation patterns identified. In addition, to potentially improve the
energy sector’s preparedness for winter, the skill of seasonal weather forecasts to
predict winter energy demand is assessed.
The analysis indicates that energy demand has a strong anti-correlation with
temperature, once socio-economic influences are removed. A 1
◦C reduction in temperature typically gives a 1\% increase in daily electricity demand and a 3\%-4\%
increase in gas demand. The risk of extreme demand is assessed using a long temperature record and the modern-day temperature-demand relationship. For example, the risk of a winter having at least as much energy demand as December 2010
is estimated to be one in ∼34 years (95\% confidence interval of 20-60 years).
To assess the ability of wind turbines to provide power during high electricity
demand, the relationship between wind power and demand is characterised. In
winter, average wind power availability reduces by a third between lower and higher
demand. However, during highest demand there is a modest recovery in wind power.
This relationship is driven by the large-scale weather patterns affecting Northern
Europe. During high demand events, neighbouring countries may struggle to provide
additional capacity due to concurrent low temperatures and reduced wind power.
Skilful predictions of winter mean gas demand and the number of extreme demand days over the winter period are possible from seasonal forecasts initialised in
November. Use of such forecasts could help improve the security of gas supplies and
reduce the impacts associated with extreme demand events.},
